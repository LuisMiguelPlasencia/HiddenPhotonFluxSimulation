# HiddenPhotonFluxSimulation-
Code for simulating the Hidden Photon Flux in the Earth and obtaining bounds for the mixing kinetic parameter. 
As a reminder, it is important to have downloaded and located all the data for solar models in the same file from (https://github.com/sebhoof/SolarAxionFlux).
Besides, Gaunt Factor Matrix has to be calculated for every solar model! In 'matriz_Gaunt.dat' one can find the values for Gaunt Factor for energies from 0.5 KeV to 15 keV in all solar radius for AGS05 solar model.
